# DEEP FAKE DETECTION

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The problem lies in distinguishing between genuine and fabricated images or videos generated using advanced machine learning techologies, such as deep neural networks, which can generate highly convincing and indistinguishable fakes.
 The challenge is to devise innovative and reliable algorithms and methodologies that can detect deepfakes across various platforms and media formats, enabling users and organizations.


## Libraries Used

* Python
* Numpy
* Deep Learning
* CNN
* LSTM
* Flask


# Steps Done

1.Dataset Preparation: Collect and label a diverse dataset of real and fake videos/images.

2.Data Preprocessing: Split the dataset and preprocess the data, including resizing and normalization.

3.CNN Training: Train a CNN model to extract visual features that distinguish real from fake samples.

4.LSTM Training: Extract features using the CNN model and train an LSTM model to capture temporal patterns.

5.Ensemble Model or Fusion: Combine the outputs of the CNN and LSTM models for improved detection.

6.Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and F1 score on a testing dataset.

7.Deployment and Testing: Deploy the model in real-world applications and continually monitor and update it.

These steps provide a concise overview of the process involved in deep fake detection using CNN and LSTM models.
